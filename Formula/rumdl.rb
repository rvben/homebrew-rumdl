  # No `version` line on purpose: Homebrew scans the version out of the urls
  # below, and declaring it as well fails `brew audit` ("redundant with version
  # scanned from URL"). The urls therefore carry the version literally, and
  # scripts/verify-formula.sh checks that every one of them agrees.
  # scripts/update-formula.sh rewrites them together.
